## 1. Abstract:
We have seen the days when attendence was taken using lists on paper , that was too time consuming  and record was difficult to keep. A better way was needed , so now the lists are being circulated amond the students so that they can mark their attendence on their own. It is a good way of saving time of the teacher. But it is facing some serious problems. Problems like the students make false attendence of their friends who do not attend that class. This is quite a big issue because it not only consumes  more time as the professor has to check whether the attendence taken is correctly marked or not . Biometrics are also used, but as can be seen as compared to paper lists, biometric devices are a bit expensive and need to handled with care. So we have come up a really better way of taking attendance which can reduce the possibility of proxies to a great extent. Attendence will be taken using a camera . The camera will be circulated among the students. Attendence will be marked using face detection.  The camera and the professor's laptop should be connected with the same local network. Attendence list will automatically be saved on the professor's laptop. The database of the students sould be saved on the laptop so that the faces will be matched accordingly. 
## 2.Motivation:
  - A good amount of time can be saved which was being wasted while taking     attendance manually.
  - Biometric attendance is also time consuming .
  - Attendance system becomes convinient ,reliable and problem of proxy is also     overcomed with an advanced method.
  - A separate folder is made where data of any number of people can be feeded and     can be altered by the authority any time as per the need with no change in code     .
## 3.Cost structure:
   It is absolutely cost free.Our project uses just a laptop(which can belong to    the authority's personal pc who is willing to mark the attendane) and a mobile      phone with IP Webcam installed (it is a free app). 
## 4.Applications:
   The system has wide range of applications in various feilds like in    industries,schools,hospitals,banks or in any office where we want to register    who is entering or leaving at any perticular time.
## 5. Limitations:
   - The system marks the attendance even if photo of any person is brought near      the camera.
   - The process recquires us to circulate the mobile phone.
## 6. Future Improvement:
   - We can make an android app for better execution of the system.
   - We can link a google sheet with attendance along with proper time and date so      that every member can watch himself.
