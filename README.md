#### SHRISHTI PROJECT :-
# SMART CLASS ATTENDANCE SYSTEM:
## Description:
We have seen the days when attendence was taken using lists on paper , that was too time consuming and record was difficult to keep. A better way was needed , so nowadays the lists are being circulated among the students so that they can mark their attendence on their own. It is a good way of saving time of the teacher. But it is facing some serious problems. Problems like the students make false attendence of their friends who do not attend that class. This is quite a big issue because it not only consumes more time as the professor has to check whether the attendence taken is correctly marked or not . Biometrics are also used, but as can be seen as compared to paper lists, biometric devices are a bit expensive and need to handled with care. So we have come up a really better way of taking attendance which can reduce the possibility of proxies to a great extent. Attendence will be taken using a camera. The camera will be circulated among the students. Attendence will be marked using face detection. The camera and the professor's laptop should be connected with the same local network. Attendence list will automatically be saved on the professor's laptop. The list can be designed as required and it will be updated everyday automatically. We can also use google sheets for keeping the attendence record, so that it wont occupy space on the laptop and the students may also see their attendence. The database of the students sould be saved on the laptop so that the faces will be matched accordingly. Hence, in this method of taking attence the student has to be physically present in the class so the chances of proxies is very less. The best advantage of this whole thing lies in its vast areas of application. It can be used at every office which  requires to take attendence of their employees.
## Motivation:
  - A good amount of time can be saved which was being wasted while taking  attendance manually.
  - Biometric attendance is also time consuming .
  - Attendance system becomes convinient ,reliable and problem of proxy is also overcomed with an advanced method.
  - A separate folder is made where data of any number of people can be feeded and can be altered by the authority any time as per the need with no change in code  
## INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
## Cost structure:
   It is absolutely cost free.Our project uses just a laptop(which can belong to    the authority's personal pc who is willing to mark the attendane) and a mobile phone with IP Webcam installed (it is a free app). 
## Applications:
   The system has wide range of applications in various fields like in industries,schools,hospitals,banks or in any office where we want to register who is entering or leaving at any particular time.
## Limitations:
   - The system marks the attendance for a photograph too.
   - the time constraint varies with the picture quality of the phone.
## Future Improvement:
   - We can make an android app or add an HTML page for a better GUI and thus more useful.
   - database management can be implimented to make this versatile in order to apply in real life.
   - We can link a google sheet with attendance along with proper time and date so that every member can watch himself.
